## üìå Business Problem Definition

### Business Context

- **Company Type:** Premier League Media Company
- **Department:** Sports Analytics & Digital Content
- **Industry:** Sports Media & Entertainment

### Data Challenge

Current player performance reporting only provides **basic season totals** and **static rankings**.  
We lack dynamic analytical capabilities to:

- Track player consistency
- Identify performance trends
- Segment players by performance value relative to cost

### Expected Outcome

Enable creation of **interactive fan features** such as:

- Player Form Guides
- Performance Comparison Tools
- Data-driven articles

These will help identify **market inefficiencies** and optimize **content strategy**.

### Success Criteria

- **Top 3 players by average rating per team** ‚Üí `RANK()`
- **Running total of goals and 3-game performance metrics** ‚Üí `SUM() OVER()`
- **Match-to-match performance growth percentage** ‚Üí `LAG()`/ `LEAD()`
- **Player performance quartiles** ‚Üí `NTILE(4)`
- **Cumulative performance distribution** ‚Üí `CUME_DIST()`

## üßÆ Window Functions Implementation

### 1. Ranking Functions

- **Use Case:** Player of the Season analysis
- Files: `ranking_query.sql`, `ranking_results.png`
- **Insight:** Multiple ranking methods show Cole Palmer as standout performer with perfect percentile rank.

---

### 2. Aggregate Functions with Framing

- **Use Case:** Player form analysis and consistency tracking
- Files: `aggregate_query.sql`, `aggregate_results.png`
- **Insight:** Running totals reveal season progress. 3-game averages smooth volatility ‚Üí better form analysis.

---

### 3. Navigation Functions

- **Use Case:** Match-to-match performance trend analysis
- Files: `navigation_query.sql`, `navigation_results.png`
- **Insight:** Highlights volatility and tactical effects not visible in season totals.

---

### 4. Distribution Functions

- **Use Case:** Player valuation & contract analysis
- Files: `distribution_query.sql`, `distribution_results.png`
- **Insight:** Quartiles and cumulative distribution identify tiers and market inefficiencies.

## üìä Results Analysis

### Descriptive Analysis

- Clear **performance tiers** emerged.
- High market value ‚â† consistent performance.

### Diagnostic Analysis

- Performance influenced by **tactics, opposition, and competition context**.
